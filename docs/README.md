## General rules

1. Quote entertaining phrases said by people **other than yourself**. 
   Do not "laugh at your own jokes".
   If you really want to quote your own phrase, include other people's phrases or actions.
2. Only quote phrases that are not already saved in the chat.
3. Stick to quoting spoken phrases.
   If a phrase you want to quote is written in a chat. you can just forward it.
   However, you can include messages in a quote **if they provide context to spoken phrases**.
4. Stick to quoting people from Innopolis or in Innopolis. 
   If you want to share an entertaining phrase of your relative, friend from your city, etc., you can just send it.
   However, you can freely include them in quotes with people from Innopolis **other than yourself**.
5. Do not quote if explicitly asked not to.
   If a person does not want you to share his word, he/she most probably has a reason for it.
   Maintaining a good relationship is more important than writing a funny quote.
6. Edit quote if corrected. 
   You can forget or misinterpret details, that other person will remember better.

## Structure of a quote

1. "#quote"
    
    The hashtag allows to distinguish quotes from regular messages. 
    It also simplifies searching for other quotes.
2. Phrases and actions

    A quote should have at least one phrase.

    * Phrase structure (parts in brackets are optional):
   >__Name *(\*Condition\*)* : Phrase *(\*Action during a phrase\*)*__
    * Action structure (parts in brackets are optional):
   >__*(Name:)* \*Action\*__

## Giving a name

The "name" part of a quote must indicate the author of a certain phrase.
When you make a first quote with a specific person, ask yourself the following questions:

1. **Will this person appear in quotes frequently?**
   
   If you are not sure that this person will appear in quotes often, do not give them a unique name.
   Instead, you can just name them by the group they belong to, such as "student", "TA", "tourist".
2. **How most people call this person?**
   
   If people prefer to call this person by his surname, you should also use the surname as an identifier.
   A popular nickname can also be used instead of name.
3. **Is this the first time person with chosen name appears in quotes?**
   
   If this is a first appearance of a name, use it.
   Otherwise, add specification in form **Name_Specification**. 
   The specification is usually a characteristic of this person known to most people.

If a person was quoted before, just use already existing name.

## Anniversary quotes
